This repository contains the relevant code for the graduation project 'Photon' by Niek Rutten.
The repository contains 5 relevant files, 3 c# scripts implemented in Unity and 2 Arduino sketches running on 2 different ESP32 modules in the prototype.
The two Arduino sketches gather data from sensors connected to the ESP32 modules and send it to a host PC.
The two "Listener" scripts receive this data.
The "Main" script converts the received sensor readings and combines them with a vive tracker's position to calculate and send dimming values to a lightsketching luminaire.
Not the entire unity project is included but details on how the unity scene is set up are detailed below as well as the circuit diagram and details for the electronics.

**Unity Setup**
The unity project is running on a pc to which a vive headset and vive tracker 2.0 is connected. The project is adapted from the VR core template.
The SteamVR plugin (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamvr-plugin-32647) is required and Steam & SteamVR must be installed.
The project tracks which bulbs to affect by tracking collisions between a sphere representing the prototype and cylinders representing the bulb's beams.

The sphere has a tracker object parent which follows the vive tracker trough the SteamVR_TrackedObject script included in the SteamVR plug in (make sure the appopriate device is selected).

The Sphere itself contains the 3 scripts included in the repository (the Main script references the Listener scripts so make sure to link those by dragging the scripts to the appropriate fields).
It also contains a collider, make sure "Is Trigger" is checked.

Each cylinder represents one bulb. Each cylinder contains a collider and has a tag indicating which bulb it represents. For easy calibration all cylinders share an empty "fixtures" parent.

Calibrate the position of the cylinders by using the tracker to check the position of the fixture in the real world and moving the "fixture" object to that point.
When running the Unity scene make sure the ESP32 modules, the fixtures and the pc are all on the same network.

**Electronics**
The sensor data is gathered by two ESP32 modules (https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/met-wi-fi/esp32-d0wdq6-development-board-met-li-ion-li-po-laadcircuit).
The sensors collecting the data are an AS5600 magnetic encoder module connected to each ESP32 (https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/sensoren/magnetisch-veld/as5600-magnetische-hoeksensor-encoder-module) and
a VL6180 time of flight distance sensor connected only to the left ESP32 (https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/sensoren/afstand/vl6180-time-of-flight-tof-afstandssensor).
Positioning of the sensors in the prototype is indicated in the images below. Both ESP32's are powered by 2 AAA batteries each.

Below a circuit diagram is added which shows how the sensors are connected to the ESP32 modules. The left and right circuits reflect the left and right ESP32 modules respectively.
